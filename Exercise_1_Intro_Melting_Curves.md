# **Exercise 1 — Introduction to DNA Melting Curves**

## **Overview**
DNA melting curves describe how double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) separates into single strands as temperature increases.  
This exercise teaches students how melting curves are generated, how to interpret them, and how sequence composition affects melting behavior.

---

## **Purpose**
This exercise helps students:

- Understand how melting curves are generated from thermodynamic models.  
- Identify key features of a melting curve (baseline, transition region, Tm).  
- Interpret how sequence composition (GC/AT content) affects melting behavior.  
- Apply melting-curve analysis to distinguish between different DNA amplicons.

---

## **Exercise Scenario**
You are assisting a new member in a PCR workflow lab. They are confused about how to read melting curves from the simulator and from real experiments.  
Your task is to analyze several reference melting curves and explain their key features.

# **Background Concepts**

## **What a DNA Melting Curve Represents**
A DNA melting curve shows how a population of dsDNA molecules gradually separates into single-stranded DNA as temperature increases.  
The simulator measures **Fraction Melted**, which ranges from:

- **0.0** → completely double-stranded  
- **1.0** → completely single-stranded  

Plotting Fraction Melted vs Temperature produces the characteristic **S-shaped (sigmoidal)** curve.

---

## **How a Melting Curve Is Generated**
Melting occurs in three stages:

### **1. Low Temperature — Baseline**
- DNA is fully double-stranded  
- Fraction Melted ≈ 0.0  
- Curve is flat  

### **2. Transition Region — Cooperative Melting**
- Local regions begin to denature  
- Once one section melts, neighboring regions destabilize  
- This cooperative effect creates the steep slope  

### **3. High Temperature — Plateau**
- All DNA is single-stranded  
- Fraction Melted ≈ 1.0  
- Curve becomes flat again  

Most melting simulators use the **Nearest-Neighbor Thermodynamic Model** (SantaLucia model) to compute base-pair stability.

---

## **Melting Temperature (Tm)**
The **Tm** is:

> The temperature at which **50%** of the DNA molecules are melted.  

It indicates how stable the DNA duplex is.  
Higher Tm → more stable (GC-rich).  
Lower Tm → less stable (AT-rich).

---

## **Why AT-rich and GC-rich DNA Melt Differently**
- **GC pairs have 3 hydrogen bonds**  
- **AT pairs have 2 hydrogen bonds**  
- GC bases also have stronger base-stacking  

Therefore:
- GC-rich sequences → **higher Tm**  
- AT-rich sequences → **lower Tm**

---

**Why AT-rich and GC-rich DNA Melt Differently**
GC pairs: 3 hydrogen bonds + stronger stacking
AT pairs: 2 hydrogen bonds
Therefore:
GC-rich sequences → higher Tm
AT-rich sequences → lower Tm
Students will observe this directly in Task 4.

---

**Short (<100 bp) vs Long DNA Melting Behavior**

**Short DNA (<100 bp)**
Typically melts all at once
Produces a simple, sigmoidal melting curve
Has a single peak in the first-derivative curve
Tm is well-defined and reliable
**Example (Simulated)**
Sequence A (86 bp): smooth S-curve, one transition
Derivative: one sharp peak

---

**Longer DNA (>200 bp)**
Contains regions with different GC content
Low-GC domains melt earlier
High-GC domains melt later
Produces multi-phase melting curves
First-derivative curve shows multiple peaks
**Example (Simulated)**
Sequence B (240 bp): shoulder + second slope
Derivative: two distinct peaks indicating two melt domains

---

## **Example Melting Curve (Simulated)**

This plot illustrates the typical S-shaped melting profile generated by a thermodynamic model.

---

**Why Longer Sequences Have Multiple Melting Domains**
GC-rich regions are more stable
AT-rich regions open first
The molecule does not melt in a single step
This creates two or more melting transitions
Students will visualize this using derivative curves

---

**Common Misconception Box**
**Misconception: **“A DNA sequence has one Tm.”

**Reality:**
Short DNA usually has one melting transition.
Longer DNA may have multiple melting domains and therefore multiple melting peaks.

---

**First-Derivative Melting Curves (–dF/dT)**
The derivative curve plots how rapidly DNA is melting at each temperature.
**Short DNA:** one sharp peak (one melting domain)
**Long DNA:** two or more peaks (multiple melting domains)
Derivative curves make it easier to visually identify Tm and melting transitions.

---

**Additional Factors That Influence Melting Curves**

Besides GC content and sequence length, several conditions can shift melting behavior:

Salt concentration: Higher Na⁺ or Mg²⁺ stabilizes dsDNA, increasing Tm.
Buffer components: Additives like DMSO or formamide lower Tm by weakening base pairing.
Sequence complexity: Repeats or homopolymer regions melt less uniformly.
Mismatches: Even a single mismatch can reduce Tm and change curve shape.
These factors help explain why melting curves in real experiments may differ slightly from ideal simulated curves.

**High Resolution Melting (HRM) — Brief Introduction**

High-Resolution Melting (HRM) is a sensitive method that detects small sequence differences by analyzing precise melting curves.

HRM is commonly used for:
SNP/variant detection
Mutation scanning
Allele discrimination

Small sequence differences cause subtle shifts in melting shape or Tm, which HRM can detect with high accuracy.

---

**Tasks**

**1. Visualize Melting Curves**
Plot the melting curve for:
Sequence A (short, <100 bp)
Sequence B (longer, >200 bp)
Label:
Low-temperature baseline
Cooperative transition region(s)
Tm or Tm peaks

---

**2. Determine the Tm**
For each curve:
Identify temperature where Fraction Melted = 0.5 (if single-domain)
Identify the main derivative peak (if multi-domain)
Record these values.

---

**3. Compare Short vs Long Melting Behavior**
Answer:
Why does the short DNA melt in one smooth step?
Why does the long DNA have multiple melting transitions?
How do derivative peaks help identify melting domains?

---

**4. Compare AT-rich vs GC-rich Amplicons**
You will be given:
Curve A: AT-rich
Curve B: GC-rich
Answer:
Which curve has lower Tm?
Which sequence is more stable?
What sequence feature explains this difference?

---

**5. Rule-of-Thumb Tm Estimates**
Using the short DNA sequence (<100 bp):
Calculate Tm using the simple formula:
**Tm ≈ 2°C × (A+T) + 4°C × (G+C)**
Use an online Tm calculator.
Compare both with the simulator’s Tm.
Write a short explanation of similarities/differences.

---

**6. Application Question**
Provide one real-world example of melting curve applications:
Checking PCR product specificity
Detecting SNPs
Genotyping alleles
Assessing DNA stability
