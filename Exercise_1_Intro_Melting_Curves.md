# **Exercise 1 — Introduction to DNA Melting Curves**

## **Overview**
This exercise introduces students to the fundamentals of DNA melting behavior.  
Students will explore how double-stranded DNA transitions to single-stranded form as temperature increases, how melting temperature (Tm) is defined, and how melting curves are interpreted in molecular assays.

## **Purpose**
This exercise helps students:

- Understand how melting curves are generated from thermodynamic models.  
- Identify key features of a melting curve (baseline, transition region, Tm).  
- Interpret how sequence composition (GC/AT content) affects melting behavior.  
- Apply melting-curve analysis to distinguish between different DNA amplicons.

## **Exercise Scenario**
You are assisting a new member in a PCR workflow lab. They are confused about how to read melting curves from the simulator and from real experiments.  
Your task is to analyze several reference melting curves and explain their key features.

---

## **Tasks**

### **1. Visualize a Melting Curve**
Load the provided dataset (Temperature vs Fraction Melted).  
Plot the melting curve and label:

- Low-temperature baseline  
- Cooperative transition region  
- Melting temperature (Tm = 50% melted)

---

### **2. Determine the Tm**
Using your plotted curve, identify:
- The exact temperature at which Fraction Melted = 0.5  

Record this value as the **Tm**.

---

### **3. Interpret Curve Shape**
In your own words, describe:

- Why the curve begins with a flat baseline  
- Why the transition region is steep  
- Why the curve plateaus at high temperature  

---

### **4. Compare Two Amplicons**
You will be given two melting curves:

- **Curve A:** AT-rich sequence  
- **Curve B:** GC-rich sequence  

Compare them and answer:

- Which curve melts at a lower temperature?  
- Which amplicon is more stable?  
- What sequence feature explains this difference?

---

### **5. Application Question**
Provide one real-world example of how melting curve analysis is used in molecular biology:
- PCR product specificity  
- Variant detection  
- Amplicon identification  
- DNA stability assessment  

---

## **Expected Outcomes (Instructor Key)**

- **Tm identification:** Students correctly locate the 50% melting point on the curve.  
- **Curve shape explanation:** Students describe cooperative melting (sharp transition due to base-pair coupling).  
- **Stability comparison:**  
  - AT-rich sequence → melts earlier  
  - GC-rich sequence → higher stability (more hydrogen bonds + base stacking)  
- **Application:** Any valid molecular assay use-case receives full credit.
