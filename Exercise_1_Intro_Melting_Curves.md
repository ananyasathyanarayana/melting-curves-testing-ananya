# **Exercise 1 — Introduction to DNA Melting Curves**

## **Overview**
DNA melting curves describe how double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) separates into single strands as temperature increases.  
This exercise teaches students how melting curves are generated, how to interpret them, and how sequence composition affects melting behavior.

---

## **Purpose**
This exercise helps students:

- Understand how melting curves are generated from thermodynamic models.  
- Identify key features of a melting curve (baseline, transition region, Tm).  
- Interpret how sequence composition (GC/AT content) affects melting behavior.  
- Apply melting-curve analysis to distinguish between different DNA amplicons.

---

## **Exercise Scenario**
You are assisting a new member in a PCR workflow lab. They are confused about how to read melting curves from the simulator and from real experiments.  
Your task is to analyze several reference melting curves and explain their key features.

# **Background Concepts**

## **What a DNA Melting Curve Represents**
A DNA melting curve shows how a population of dsDNA molecules gradually separates into single-stranded DNA as temperature increases.  
The simulator measures **Fraction Melted**, which ranges from:

- **0.0** → completely double-stranded  
- **1.0** → completely single-stranded  

Plotting Fraction Melted vs Temperature produces the characteristic **S-shaped (sigmoidal)** curve.

---

## **How a Melting Curve Is Generated**
Melting occurs in three stages:

### **1. Low Temperature — Baseline**
- DNA is fully double-stranded  
- Fraction Melted ≈ 0.0  
- Curve is flat  

### **2. Transition Region — Cooperative Melting**
- Local regions begin to denature  
- Once one section melts, neighboring regions destabilize  
- This cooperative effect creates the steep slope  

### **3. High Temperature — Plateau**
- All DNA is single-stranded  
- Fraction Melted ≈ 1.0  
- Curve becomes flat again  

Most melting simulators use the **Nearest-Neighbor Thermodynamic Model** (SantaLucia model) to compute base-pair stability.

---

## **Melting Temperature (Tm)**
The **Tm** is:

> The temperature at which **50%** of the DNA molecules are melted.  

It indicates how stable the DNA duplex is.  
Higher Tm → more stable (GC-rich).  
Lower Tm → less stable (AT-rich).

---

## **Why AT-rich and GC-rich DNA Melt Differently**
- **GC pairs have 3 hydrogen bonds**  
- **AT pairs have 2 hydrogen bonds**  
- GC bases also have stronger base-stacking  

Therefore:
- GC-rich sequences → **higher Tm**  
- AT-rich sequences → **lower Tm**

Students will observe this directly in Task 4.

---

## **Factors That Influence Melting Curves**
Several biochemical and sequence-level factors affect DNA melting behavior:

### **1. GC Content**
Higher GC% increases Tm and curve steepness.

### **2. Sequence Length**
Longer sequences melt over a broader temperature range.

### **3. Salt Concentration**
More Na⁺ or Mg²⁺ stabilizes dsDNA → increases Tm.

### **4. Buffer Composition**
Additives like DMSO or formamide lower Tm.

### **5. Sequence Complexity**
Repeats or homopolymers affect melting uniformity.

### **6. Mutations or Mismatches**
A single mismatch can shift Tm — basis of mutation detection.

## **High Resolution Melting (HRM) — Brief Introduction**
HRM is an advanced technique that uses high-precision melting analysis to detect very small sequence differences.

HRM is used for:
- SNP genotyping  
- Mutation detection  
- Allele discrimination  
- DNA methylation studies  

Small sequence changes cause measurable shifts in curve shape or Tm, making HRM a powerful diagnostic tool.

# **Tasks**

## **1. Visualize a Melting Curve**
Load the provided dataset (Temperature vs Fraction Melted).  
Plot the melting curve and label:

- Low-temperature baseline  
- Cooperative transition region  
- Melting temperature (Tm = 50% melted)

---

## **2. Determine the Tm**
Using your plotted curve, identify:
- The exact temperature at which Fraction Melted = 0.5  

Record this value as the **Tm**.

---

## **3. Interpret Curve Shape**
In your own words, describe:

- Why the curve begins with a flat baseline  
- Why the transition region is steep  
- Why the curve plateaus at high temperature  

---

## **4. Compare Two Amplicons**
You will be given two melting curves:

- **Curve A:** AT-rich sequence  
- **Curve B:** GC-rich sequence  

Compare them and answer:

- Which curve melts at a lower temperature?  
- Which amplicon is more stable?  
- What sequence feature explains this difference?

---

## **5. Application Question**
Provide one real-world example of how melting curve analysis is used in molecular biology:
- PCR product specificity  
- Variant detection  
- Amplicon identification  
- DNA stability assessment

# **Glossary**

### **Tm**  
Temperature at which 50% of DNA molecules are melted.

### **Fraction Melted**  
Proportion of molecules that are single-stranded at a given temperature.

### **dsDNA**

### **ssDNA**  
Single-stranded DNA (denatured form).

### **Cooperative Melting**

# **Expected Outcomes (Instructor Key)**

- **Tm identification:** Students correctly locate the 50% melting point.  
- **Curve shape explanation:** Students describe baseline → cooperative melting → plateau.  
- **Stability comparison:**  
  - AT-rich melts earlier  
  - GC-rich has higher Tm  
- **Application:** Any valid molecular workflow explanation is acceptable.
