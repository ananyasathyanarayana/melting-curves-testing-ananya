# Melting Curves Testing - Ananya

## Purpose
Testing Cybertory melting simulators (Nearest-Neighbor and Nearest-Neighbor + HMM) against uMelt to evaluate accuracy and usability.

## Tools
- Nearest-Neighbor (NN) app
- Nearest-Neighbor + HMM app
- uMelt (reference simulator)

## Plan
- Test sequences of different lengths (short, medium, long)
- Vary sodium concentration ([Na⁺]) to observe effect on Tm
- Explore window size changes and their effect on curve smoothness
- Compare simulator results with uMelt as baseline
